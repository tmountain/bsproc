Bsproc is a bayesian spam recognition and filtering program based on
Paul Graham's essay, A Plan For Spam(http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html).
This implementation includes tweaks to the lexical analysis of mail that
are borrowed from Eric S. Raymond's bogofilter program.

Build the fast hash extension first.
$ cd ext
$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make
# make install

Run ruby install.rb to copy bayespam.rb to the appropriate place.
# ruby install.rb

Put bsproc somewhere in $PATH.
# cp bsproc /usr/local/bin

Create the following to .procmailrc

## Begin .procmailrc
LOGFILE=$HOME/procmail.log
LOCKFILE=$HOME/procmail.lock

:0HB:
* ? bsproc
mail/spam
## End .procmailrc

If you're using qmail for your smtp server then you have to create
a .qmail file with the following content:
|/usr/bin/qmail-procmail

Run bsproc to create your .probcache.db file.
bsproc -i -t spam_file -c good_file

Run bsproc on a sample message to test it. Anything with a probability of
less than .9 is considered non-spam.
bsproc test_message
test_message => .01

Enjoy spam free e-mail! Note: filtering improves as message corpus size
increases. Small corpuses lead to inaccurate results.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
